My name is Rahul Rustagi, and I am an incoming Masters student at Georgia Institute of Technology in ECE starting Fall 2024. I received my undergraduate degree at [IIT Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) in Aerosapce Engineering with Minors in Computer Systems, Machine Learning and English Literature. 

I recently worked as a Project Employee at the [Helicopter and VTOL Lab](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~abhish/) and published papers in the field of Aerial Robotics. I am proficient in writing embedded code to implementing optimisation and machine learning algorithms on flight computer during in-flight operations. 

Before this, I've done research internships at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/) (Summer 2023) and [WSN Lab, IITK](https://wsn.rajeshmhegde.com/) (Summer 2022 - Spring 2022).

My research interests broadly include **Image Processing, Control, Optimisation, Reinforcement Learning** and I am skilled in impementing these for robotics based applications.
